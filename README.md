# ex.8✔️
In a company the monthly salary of an employee is calculated by: the minimum wage 400$ per month, plus 20$ multiplied by the number of years employed, plus 30$ for each child they have.

Create a program that:
1) Reads the number of years employed
2) Reads the number of children the employee has
3) Prints the total amount of salary the employee makes

* Output: "The total amount is 560$. 400$ minimum wage + 100$ for 5 years experience + 60$ for 2 kids"

# ex.9✔️
The exercise is almost identical to a previous exercise with a minor change. In a company the monthly salary of an employee is calculated by minimum wage 400$ per month, plus 20$ multiply by the employment years, plus 30$ for each employee kid, plus 100$ if the employee didn't miss 1 day of work.

Create a program that:
* Reads the employment years
* Reads the number of each employee kids
* Prints the total amount the employee must take
* Output: "The total amount is 660$, 400$ minimum wage + 100$ for 5 years experience + 60$ for 2 kids + 100$ for not missing a day at work"

# ex.10✔️
Create a program that prints the last digit of a given integer

Create a program that:
1) Reads the integer
2) Prints the last digit

Warning! Do not use the programming language MAGIC. After you complete the exercise feel free to do so.

Warning! Don't try to convert the number into string etc.

Warning! For this problem it's ok after spending some time to look for the solution.

# ex.11✔️
You have started working and you are wondering how many things you can buy with the money you've earned. A PS4 costs 200$, a Samsung phone 900$, a TV 500$, a game skin 9.99$

Create a program:
* Notice that you can't but half TV or 1/4 of PS4.
* Reads how many hours you've worked
* Reads your hourly income
* Prints how many items you can buy
* Output: "I can buy 4 PS4, 1 Samsung, 3 TV, 80 game skin"

# ex.12✔️
You've consumed X amount of Mbps on Wikipedia and Y amount of Mbps on memes. The cost of visiting Wikipedia is 0,10$ per Mb
and the cost for watching memes is 0,05$ per Mb. If total consumption  is more than 100$ print "Too much consumption".
If watching meme consumption is greater than reading wikipedia consumption print "WOW MANY MEMES", "SUCH LOL"(in new line).

Create a program that:
* Reads X(wikipedia Mb consupmtion) and Y(watching meme Mb consumption)
* Calculates the total consumption
* If total consumption greater than 100$ print proper message
* If watching meme consumption  is greater than reading wikipedia articles print proper messages

Warning! For the greater meme consumption you will use one print statement and the output must be in seperate lines

# ex.13✔️
An internet cafe has 2 ways of charging. If the user is a member pays 2$/hour, Else the user pays 5$. Find if someone is a member or not and calculate the price based on how many hours the user spend. If the user is a member the tax is 10% else the tax is 20%.

Create a program that:
* Reads how many hours the user spend
* Check if is a member
* Add the proper tax fee
* Print the total amount the user has to pay
* Output: "The user is a member stayed 2 hours for 2$/hour plus the 10% the total amount is 4.4$"

# ex.14✔️
You want to buy something from Amazon. The seller charges different prices for shipping cost based on location. For US it's 5$ for Europe it's 7$ for Canada it's 3$ for other places it's 9$

Create a program that:
* Reads the cost of the product
* Reads your location
* Print the amount of money you have to pay
* Ouput: "You have to pay 23$, 20$ for the product and 3$ for shipping cost"

# ex.15✔️
A cell phone company has the following billing policy

|  | Fixed cost 25$  |
|---------|--------------|
| Call duration(in seconds)| Charge($/per second)|
| 1-500 | 0,01 |
| 501-800 | 0,008 |
| 801+ | 0,005 |

Create a program that:
* Reads how many seconds was the calls duration
* Calculates the monthly bill for the subscriber
* Prints the total amount
* Output: "total amount: 48$"

#### Notice that that the charge for the first 500 seconds it's 0,01$ then for the next 501 to 800 seconds it's 0,008 and then it's 0,005$

# ex.16✔️
Given an integer x, return true if x is a 
palindrome
, and false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
