/*# ex.2
It's the end of the semester and you got your grades from three classes: Geometry, Algebra, and Physics.

Create a program that:
1) Reads the grades of these 3 classes (Grades range from 0 - 10)
2) Calculate the average of your grades

* Example: Geometry = 6, Algebra = 7, Physics = 8
* Output: average_score = 7 */
