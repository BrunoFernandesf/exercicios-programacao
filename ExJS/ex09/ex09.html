    <!--The exercise is almost identical to a previous exercise with a minor change. In a company the monthly salary of an employee is calculated by minimum wage 400$ per month, plus 20$ multiply by the employment years, plus 30$ for each employee kid, plus 100$ if the employee didn't miss 1 day of work.

    Create a program that:
    * Reads the employment years
    * Reads the number of each employee kids
    * Prints the total amount the employee must take
    * Output: "The total amount is 660$, 400$ minimum wage + 100$ for 5 years experience + 60$ for 2 kids + 100$ for not missing a day at work"-->
