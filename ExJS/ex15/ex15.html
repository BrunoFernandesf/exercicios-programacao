    A cell phone company has the following billing policy

    |  | Fixed cost 25$  |
    |---------|--------------|
    | Call duration(in seconds)| Charge($/per second)|
    | 1-500 | 0,01 |
    | 501-800 | 0,008 |
    | 801+ | 0,005 |

    Create a program that:
    * Reads how many seconds was the calls duration
    * Calculates the monthly bill for the subscriber
    * Prints the total amount
    * Output: "total amount: 48$"

    #### Notice that that the charge for the first 500 seconds it's 0,01$ then for the next 501 to 800 seconds it's 0,008 and then it's 0,005$-->
