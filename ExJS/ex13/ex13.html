    An internet cafe has 2 ways of charging. If the user is a member pays 2$/hour, Else the user pays 5$. Find if someone is a member or not and calculate the price based on how many hours the user spend. If the user is a member the tax is 10% else the tax is 20%.

    Create a program that:
    * Reads how many hours the user spend
    * Check if is a member
    * Add the proper tax fee
    * Print the total amount the user has to pay
    * Output: "The user is a member stayed 2 hours for 2$/hour plus the 10% the total amount is 4.4$"-->
